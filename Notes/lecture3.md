### Q: What is JSX?
A: JSX stands for `JavaScript XML`, It allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript without writing createElement in React which makes React code more confusing and inefficient. JSX is not part of React. JSX makes it easier to add HTML in React. JSX converts HTML code into JavaScript code that React can understand and renders in the DOM. React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX.
 
Here's a simple example of JSX:
```
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

In the above code, looks like HTML, but it's JSX. When this code is transpiled, it turns into JavaScript code that creates a React element, which can be rendered in a React application.

### Q: Rules of JSX
A: **1. Return a single root element** - To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.
For instance, We can use <div>
```
<div>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```
If you donâ€™t want to add an extra <div> to your markup, you can write <> and </> instead
```
<>
  <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
  >
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</>
```
This empty tag is called a **Fragment**. Fragments let you group things without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.

**2. Close all the tags**
JSX requires tags to be explicitly closed: self-closing tags like <img> must become <img />, and wrapping tags like `<li>oranges must be written as <li>oranges</li>`.

```
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### Q: Superpowers of JSX:
A: `Integration of HTML-like Syntax` - JSX allows us to write code that looks like HTML in JavaScript. This makes it easy for developers to create user interfaces.

`Component-Based Structure` - JSX is especially powerful when used with libraries like React. It enables us to create reusable UI components, making our code more modular and maintainable.

`Dynamic Data Binding` - We can embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using curly braces, allowing us to easily include and manipulate dynamic data within your user interfaces. JSX is easy to maintain and debug.

### Q: Role of type attribute in a script tag? What options can I use there?
A: The type attribute in a <script> tag is used to specify the media type of the script content. It tells the browser how to interpret the script. There are a few different values you can use with the type attribute:

`Omitted or Empty String`: If the type attribute is omitted or set to an empty string (type=""), the browser will assume the default JavaScript type, which is **text/javascript**. This is the most commonly used type for JavaScript, and it's supported by all modern browsers.

**Example:**
```
<script>
    // JavaScript code here
</script>
```

`text/javascript (Deprecated)`: While it used to be the default and widely used, specifying type="text/javascript" is no longer necessary in modern web development. Browsers assume the script is JavaScript by default. You can still use it for compatibility reasons, but it's not required.

**Example:**
```
<script type="text/javascript">
    // JavaScript code here
</script>
```

`module`: When we specify type="module", the script is treated as an ECMAScript module. This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.
**Example**:
```
<script type="module">
    // JavaScript module code here
</script>
```

`text/babel`: This value indicates that the script is a babel type and requires the Babel JavaScript compiler to transpile JSX code.
`text/typescript`: The script is written in TypeScript.

### Q: `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`
A: `{TitleComponent}` - This expression is used when we want to embed a component as a javascript expression or a variable.
**Example:**
```
const TitleComponent = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            {TitleComponent}
        </div>
    );
};
```

`{<TitleComponent/>}` - This expression creates and renders an instance of the **TitleComponent** component.
It's the most common way to use a component in JSX when we want to render the component as part of your UI. Most commonly, you will use {<TitleComponent/>} to create and render a component.

**Example**
```
const TitleComponent = () => <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <TitleComponent />
        </div>
    );
};
```

`{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` - This is essentially the same as `{<TitleComponent/>}` in most cases. Both create and render an instance of the **TitleComponent** component. The explicit use of opening and closing tags might be used in situations where we want to include child elements within the TitleComponent.
**Example:**
```
<TitleComponent>
    <Header />
    <MainContainer/>
    <SecondContainer/>
</TitleComponent>
```
